FUPE: A security driven task scheduling approach for SDN-based IoT–Fog networks

Fog computing is a paradigm to overcome the cloud computing limitations which provides low latency to the users’ applications for the Internet of Things (IoT). Software-defined networking (SDN) is a practical networking infrastructure that provides a great capability in managing network flows. SDN switches are powerful devices, which can be used as fog devices/fog gateways simultaneously. Hence, fog devices are more vulnerable to several attacks. TCP SYN flood attack is one of the most common denial of service attacks, in which a malicious node produces many half-open TCP connections on the targeted computational nodes so as to break them down. Motivated by this, in this paper, we apply SDN concepts to address TCP SYN flood attacks in IoT–fog networks . We propose FUPE, a security-aware task scheduler in IoT–fog networks. FUPE puts forward a fuzzy-based multi-objective particle swarm …
